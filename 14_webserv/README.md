# Webserv: 42 School Project

## Description

This project involves the development of a `C++98` compatible HTTP web server built from scratch. The server is designed to be non-blocking and uses I/O multiplexing (via poll()) to efficiently handle multiple concurrent client connections.

Key features include:
- **HTTP Methods**: Support for `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` requests.
- **Static Content**: Serving static files from a configured root directory.
- **File Uploads**: Handling file uploads from clients to the server.
- **CGI Execution**: Executing dynamic scripts (e.g., Python, PHP) based on file extensions.
- **Configuration**: A robust configuration system inspired by NGINX, allowing the definition of routes, error pages, and server limits via a `.conf` file.
- **Resilience**: Designed to remain operational at all times without crashing.

## Stress Tests:

- Stress test with high concurrency
```bash
siege -b -c 100 -t 1m http://localhost:4242/
```
```bash
siege -r 100 -c 20 http://localhost:4242/
```

- Count open file descriptors for the server process.
```bash
lsof -i :4242 | grep LISTEN
```

- View established connections on the server port.
```bash
netstat -ant | grep 4242
```

### **RFC**
An RFC (Request for Comments) is a formal technical document published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that describes the protocols, methods, procedures, and research applicable to the Internet and network-connected systems.

- HTTP/1.0 → [RFC 1945](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1945.html).
- HTTP/1.1 → [RFC 2616 (old)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616).

**HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundational communication standard used to exchange information—like text, images, and video—on the World Wide Web.

- TCP → [RFC 793](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc793).

The **Transmission Control Protocol** (TCP) is intended for use as a highly reliable **host-to-host protocol** between hosts in **packet-switched** computer communication networks, and in interconnected systems of such networks.

## **AI Usage**
This project utilized Google Gemini Pro (student lisence) as a technical mentor and documentation assistant. The AI was contextually configured with the full project subject (en.subject.pdf) to ensure strict adherence to 42 School constraints (C++98 standard, forbidden functions, and NGINX behavior imitation).

Role: The AI acted as a "virtual professor" or technical lead, facilitating architectural discussions for core classes and core concepts.

- Core Server (C++): The AI doesn't allowed to generate the final source code for the server's logic (parser, socket management, request/response handling). Its primary function was to validate logic, review specific C++ implementations for memory safety, and suggest best practices for "Clean Code."

- Test Assets (Website): AI tools were used to generate the content within the website/ directory (HTML, CSS, and basic CGI scripts). This allowed for efficient creation of testing materials to verify the server's features (such as static file serving and error handling) without diverting time from the mandatory backend implementation.
